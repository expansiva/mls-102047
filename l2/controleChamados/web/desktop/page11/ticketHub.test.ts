// GENERATED — declarative BFF test cases run server-side by the monitor Tests runner (wherever
// TESTS_ENABLED is on).
// Data, not a runnable test module: no node:test import, so scripts/run-tests.mjs never captures it.
// Params valued "<seedRef>" are ENTITY IDS this page itself reads: the runner resolves them at
// run time from the harvested output of this page's read queries (including the rows of any array in
// the envelope). "<seedValue>" is the value of that field on a seeded row; "<seedSpare>"
// is a leftover valid value for a create command (reusing a seeded unique value would collide).
// paramFieldRefs maps those params to the l4 fieldRef so the pool can match by ontology field, not by
// the input's wire name. Literals stay for free input with no entity counterpart (pagination, typed
// format, closed enum). expect.itemsKey names the collection the wire returns
// for a paginated query (the runner assumes "items" when it is absent). "actor" is this page's l4 actor:
// the run executes these cases as the seeded platform identity of that actor, so a route that reads the
// actor id from the session is runnable headless.
